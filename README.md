## You May Encounter a Few Errors 
### When Working with Your First DJango Project
#### And during deployment
##### This brief repo highlights some common issues and how you can fix them
###### I Hope it saves you a headache!


# Development Bugs
### Cannot find reference 'url' ; 
#### Import django.conf.urls could not be resolved; 
#### cannot import name 'url' from 'django.conf.urls'

* instead of:

`from django.conf.urls import url`

* use:

`from django.urls import re_path`

* You can then use re_path the same way you would have used url

* Instead of entirely replacing url with re_path, you can also use:

`from django.urls import re_path as url`


### Couldn't import Django. Are you sure it's installed and available on your PYTHONPATH environment variable?

    Solution 1:

* On your pc's terminal, run `pip install pipenv`

* Open/reopen your project in your code editor

* Ensure your virtual environment is active. If not...

* run `source yourvirtualenvironment/bin/activate`

* Run `pipenv install django`

* Confirm a successful installation when pipenv creates the files `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock`

      Solution 2:

* Delete your virtual environment's folder

* Create a new virtual environment... `run virtualenv venv`

* Run `source venv/bin/activate`

* Leave your project & open your pc's terminal

* Continue with the steps in `solution 1` above.


### django.db.utils.OperationalError: no such table: auth_user

* Solution 1: 

`python3 manage.py makemigrations` or `py manage.py makemigrations`

    Next possible error: no changes detected

* Try solution 2: 

`python3 manage.py migrate` or `manage.py migrate`


### TypeError: __init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'on_delete'

* Solution: 

In the class & line that throws the error, add a parameter `on_delete` and equate it to `models.CASCADE`, i.e:

    editor = models.ForeignKey(Editor,on_delete=models.CASCADE)

# Deployment Bugs

### 'heroku' does not appear to be a git repository

* run: 

`heroku git:remote -a yourappnamehere`

or 

`heroku git:remote -app yourappnamehere`


### '.herokuapp.com', is invalid. Must be in the format â–¸ FOO=bar.

* Try removing this line in your `.env` : 

`ALLOWED_HOSTS='.localhost', '.herokuapp.com', '.127.0.0.1'`

* Next possible error:

#### {} not found. Declare it as envvar or define a default value.'.format(option)

* In your poject's settings.py, search for & remove this line: 

`ALLOWED_HOSTS = config('ALLOWED_HOSTS', cast=Csv())`

* ... since we already deleted the allowed hosts option in `.env` 


## After successful deployment... 
### relation "news_article" does not exist 

* Follow these steps:

  * delete your local `migrations` folder 
  * run `heroku run bash`
  * run `python manage.py makemigrations`
  * run `cd yourappname`
  * run `ls` to confirm that you have a `migrations` directory 
  * run `cd migrations`
  * run `ls` to confirm that you do not have a `versions` directory 
  * run `mkdir versions`
  * run `cd versions`
  * run `touch .keep`
  * run `cd ~` (return to your root folder)
  * or, return step by step, i.e:
      * ru `cd ..` (return to migrations dir)
      * run `cd ..` (return to your app dir)
      * run `cd ..` (return to your root folder)

  * run `python manage.py migrate`
  * run `exit` (exit heroku bash)
  * run `git add .`
  * run `git commit -m "update remote migrations && redeploy"`
  * run `git push heroku master`

# Just a pointer
#### You will need to create a new superuser after deployment, in order to access your Admin platform. 
##### To do so... 

* Run `heroku run bash` in your local terminal. 
* When the `bash` opens... 
* Run `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
* Follow the prompted steps to create your superuser's username, email, and password. 
* Once done, run `exit` to exit `heroku bash`
* You do not need to push anything to heroku, because `heroku bash` creates the connection with your remote repo.
* You can now sign in to your admin platform on your deployed app.
